# fuzzing-101

I have decided to open source this subset of exercises and solutions,
which are part of Cyber by the Sea's *Fuzzing 101* workshop,
to offer this introduction to fuzzing to a wider community.

## Activity 1: OneMax

Implement the fitness function and mutator, indicated by `# TODO: Activity 1` in `problem.py`

For hints, see `solution.py`

## Activity 2: Knapsack

Tweak the genetic algorithm selection to overcome local optima, indicated by `# TODO: Activity 2` in `problem.py`

For hints, see `solution.py`

## Activity 3: AFL

Follow [activity_3_afl/README.md](activity_3_afl/README.md) to investigate AFL's inner workings
(many of them related to workshop content from Activity 1 & 2)
